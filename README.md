# OpenLens Build Repo

This is the community version of the [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) which means basically it is the same IDE built upon the same platform but lacks the proprietary components. It is free of charge and based on MIT license.

Since  lately Lens IDE has mandated to create a Lens ID and associate with the installation and to procure a valid subscription, it haas become necessary to shift to this method.

This repo  does not contains the actual Lens cource code, it repo only builds the binary from the actual source code.
At present I am building only the  binary for Windows platfrom but the action can be modified to also build binaries for Linux or macOS.
